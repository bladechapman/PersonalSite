		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight">HI, I'm Blade!</span> FUN FACT! I share my name with a cutting utensil! I've played the violin for 10 years and love locking myself in my room to code, so obviously I'm one of them cool kids.
		</p>
		<p>
			My focus at the moment is on client-side development. I love building clever logic into front-facing software as well as creating enjoyable user experiences. My strengths include iOS development, Java, and C++ in addition to experience with C and the web-languages.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently I'm a sophomore in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Most of my time ends up going to tinkering, schoolwork or working on fun personal projects, but I enjoy hashing out a plan for world domination every once in a while.

		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>
			Whether for work, school, or play, I love creating! Here are a few of my favorite projects from recent memory. You can check out an even better profile of my work and the people I love working with at <a href="http://www.github.com/bladechapman" target="_blank">my GitHub page!</a>
		</p>

		<h6>Classkick</h6>
		<p>
			Software engineering intern for 1871 startup Classkick, a mobile education platform designed to give students instant and effective feedback. I worked on a small, fast-paced mobile development team to implement features and infrastructure and carry the app to launch. Check them out at <a href="http://getclasskick.com" target="_blank">getclasskick.com</a>, or download it for iPad <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/classkick/id909904332" target="_blank">here!</a>
		</p>

		<h6>Toss</h6>
		<p>
			IEEE CapitalOne 2013 Hackathon First Place! Allows user to draw and send images from a mobile device to a computer's clipboard instantly! My work included handling network protocols, encoding, and custom drawing algorithms for the iOS app. Expect to see it out on the app store soon!
		</p>

		<h6>Armagetra-Snake</h6>
		<p>
			Powered by HTML5, Armagetra-Snake uses your mobile device as a controller for an online game of competitive snake! The game itself is rendered using HTML5 canvas and javascript, while controls are communicated through HTML5 websockets. Additionally, Google fast-buttons are used to reduce the latency of controls on mobile devices.
		</p>

		<h6>Air-Rise</h6>
		<p>
			Facebook 2013 Midwest Regional Hackathon Entry! Using similar technology to Toss, Air-rise allows users to take images through a mobile app and send it instantly to a computer's clipboard via a computer client running in the background. Computer client is cross-platform, and comes complete with fancy notifications when an image is recieved! A modified version of Base64 encoding is also used to ensure a quick transmit time.
		</p>

		<h6>Bounce</h6>
		<p>
			A small billiards-style iOS game built on Cocos2D that I work on in my free time. Also still in the works, so I'm gonna stay a little hush.
		</p>

		<h6>This Website!</h6>
		<p>
			My baby, and first real foray into anything web-related. So far it consists of some rather ugly looking CSS and HTML (click inspect element, I dare you) that somehow works. I've also taken the time to add some sparkly jQuery elements and implement some light reactive programming techniques for the mobile version.
